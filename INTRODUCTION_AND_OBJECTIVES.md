# NASSCOM_Semiconductor_Packaging_Fundamentals_and_Testing
## Know how a chip looks the way it does on a PCB and how it is tested before any machine is turned on. What it takes to reduce the probability of the first ever or repeated bootup and cross chip communication to work.
### As a PD Engineer it has been a revelation when we started designing chips based on the design team and the feature requirements. But to get to know that the foundry package success depends on the PD work, oh that is a game changer. We love to blame the foundry for this and that rules, but it is more that it looks. This github is a glimpse of how the packaging is done and tested after foundry completes fabricating the waffer as per the GDSII provided by the PD/PV team.

## OBJECTIVE
This is to learn and understand how the real world chip package is and what kind of processes a chip goes through after the foundry is done fabricating them and before it is implemented on a PCB board for other chips to communicate and form a single product in our real lives

## [FUNDAMENTAL LEARNING]()
    It consists of all the basic theoritical explanation and information of how a chip is packaged for different use cases

## [TOOL APPLIED LEARNINGS](TOOL_APPLIED_LEARNINGS.md)
    This focuses on the hands-on experience using the ANSYS free too on the desktop to help understand the packages and how it can be tested and diagnosed
