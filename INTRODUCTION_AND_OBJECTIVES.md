## Know how a chip looks the way it does on a PCB and how it is tested before any machine is turned on. What it takes to reduce the probability of the first ever or repeated bootup and cross chip communication to work.
### As a PD Engineer it has been a revelation when we started designing chips based on the design team and the feature requirements.

### This github is a glimpse of how the packaging is done and tested after foundry completed fabricating the waffer
