## 🎯 Objective  
This repository captures my learning journey through semiconductor-packaging fundamentals and hands-on testing workflows — from wafer-out to PCB integration. The goal is to understand what happens post-foundry, what goes into packaging, testing, and reliability analysis before a chip becomes part of a real system.

> “Know how a chip ends up looking on a PCB — and what needs to be done before the first boot.”

## 📚 Repository Overview  

| Section | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| **FUNDAMENTAL_LEARNINGS.md** | Theoretical foundations — packaging types, interconnects, materials, standards, reliability & manufacturing workflows |
| **TOOL_APPLIED_LEARNINGS.md** | Practical exercises using ANSYS: package-level modelling, thermal & structural simulations, stress analysis, reliability assessments |

## ✅ What This Workshop Covers  

- Semiconductor packaging fundamentals: package types (QFN, BGA, WLP, Flip-Chip, 2.5D/3D), interconnects (wire-bond, micro-bumps, TSV), substrate & materials, PCB integration  
- Manufacturing flow: wafer out → die attach → molding / underfill / substrate attach → testing → packaging verification  
- Reliability and failure mechanisms: thermal cycling, solder fatigue, warpage, mechanical stress, thermal/mechanical coupling  
- Simulation-based testing using ANSYS: from structural and thermal analysis to package-level stress/strain visualization and reliability estimation
