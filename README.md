# 🧪 NASSCOM Semicon Packaging Fundamentals & Testing  
*A Complete Workshop Portfolio — Theory + ANSYS-Based Application*

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey through the **NASSCOM Semiconductor Packaging & Testing Workshop**, covering everything from foundational theory to **hands-on simulations using ANSYS**.

This repo is designed to give a structured, industry-ready overview of **post-silicon processes**, packaging flows, reliability mechanisms, and practical analysis skills.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Understand how a chip moves from *wafer* → *package* → *functional product*
- Learn semiconductor package structures, materials, and manufacturing flows
- Perform thermal, electrical, and reliability analyses using **ANSYS**
- Build a strong foundation for **Semiconductor Packaging** and **Reliability Engineering**
