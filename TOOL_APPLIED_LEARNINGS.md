# Thermal Simulation of Semiconductor Packages with ANSYS

## Getting to know ANSYS Electronics Desktop

    1. Install the free version as the steps provided in the lab manual to install the ANSYS Electronics Desktop application
    2. Once loaded check the topside for the tool designers. SInce we are doing the thermal simulation Icepak is required.

    3. Click on the IcePak and it will load a blank project to work on

    4. The list inside the project has all the elements. Liek the 3D components, boundary conditions and monitor the areas. It is the flow of the design top to bottom of any design

    5. Different geometry and can be used to create different shapes for the design on the tool
    6. Will use an inbuilt package from the toolkit. Here will use the flipchip BGA

    1. 1 W power depends on the frequency on how much the chip can withstand
    2. Heatsink may or may not be there based on the cost
