# WHY PACKAGING?
## PROTECTED ENV to REAL WORLD

1. All the components of the various chips on an SOC to all work together from the manufacturing to the real world usage
     a. Preparing die for the real world
     b. It requires Protection of semiconductor devices on die (ex: corrosion, moisture and physical damage)
     c. Connection of die to other dies (Ex: Ball Grid Array Package)

## Packaging and Testing Industry

1. Integrated Device Manufacturer (IDM): They do the design, fabricate and package too
2. Fabless: These are Semiconductor design-centric (Ex: Qualcomm, NVidia, AMD, Apple, etc.)
3. Foundry: These only focus on Wafer manufacturing by developing technolgy (Ex: TSMC, Global Foundries, SAMSUNG, etc.)
4. Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test(OSAT): They focus on packaging and testing semiconductors and wafers (Ex: ASE, Amkor, JCET, etc.)
